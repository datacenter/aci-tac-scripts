# mcast-validator

This tool is intended to verify and assist in troubleshooting routed multicast (PIM enabled) in ACI.

# Usage
1. Download the mcast_validator file and scp/ftp/sftp/etc it onto the apic.
2. cd to the location of the file.
3. Execute - ```./mcast_validator```

The tool will prompt for user inputs or inputs can be supplied at the command line. Refer to the help documentation for argument examples.

The tool also allows for option datapath debugging using the ftriage tool which automates end to end elams of the flow. Elams are a 'tripwire' in hardware where a condition is set and the first packet that matches the condition trips it, dumping a large amount of information about what the asic is doing.

There is no impact to running this tool as it only uses show commands and API GET requests.

# Limitations
This tool can assist with verifying the following routed multicast topologies:
- Mcast source is EXTERNAL to ACI (behind l3out) AND mcast receiver is INTERNAL to ACI (endpoint)
- Mcast source is INTERNAL to ACI (endpoint) AND mcast receiver is EXTERNAL to ACI (behind l3out)
- Both mcast source AND mcast receiver are INTERNAL to ACI (learned endpoints)
- Both mcast source AND mcast receiver are EXTERNAL to ACI (multicast transit routing)

It does not support the following topologies:
- Intersite multicast
- Intervrf multicast (vrf transit occurs inside of ACI, if an external device does vrf stitching this is fine)
- Additionally, while it validates many things both at the APIC and switch level, it does not validate route-maps do to the complexity this would entail.

The tool relies on many different API calls (GETs only) and show outputs, both at the switch and APIC level. Its possible some api calls will fail if switches are on a much older version than the apic.

# Help Documentation
```
usage: mcast_validator [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-t TENANT] [-v VRF] [-r RCVR]
                       [-s SRC] [-g GROUP]

This code orchestrates debugging of multicast routing in ACI.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Specify the username used for remote connections.
  -t TENANT, --tenant TENANT
                        Specify the tenant name of the multicast flow
  -v VRF, --vrf VRF     Specify the vrf name of the multicast flow
  -r RCVR, --rcvr RCVR  Specify the IP address of the multicast receiver
  -s SRC, --src SRC     Specify the IP address of the multicast source
  -g GROUP, --group GROUP
                        Specify the IP address of the multicast group
```

# Example Usage
In this example the source is not active and thus none of the necessary devices have the source installed. Its important to note anywhere the script reports a FAILURE. Datapath testing at the end also confirmed the traffic wasn't being received from the source.
```
apic1# ./mcast_validator -u josephyo -t jy -v l3vrf1 -r 39.99.61.0 -s 192.168.255.100 -g 229.0.0.103
Describe the multicast topology:
1. Mcast source is EXTERNAL to ACI (behind l3out) AND mcast receiver is INTERNAL to ACI (endpoint)
2. Mcast source is INTERNAL to ACI (endpoint) AND mcast receiver is EXTERNAL to ACI (behind l3out)
3. Both mcast source AND mcast receiver are INTERNAL to ACI (learned endpoints)
4. Both mcast source AND mcast receiver are EXTERNAL to ACI (multicast transit routing)
